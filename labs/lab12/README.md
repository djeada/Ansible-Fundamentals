## Task 12: Advanced Docker Projects & Final Capstone

**Objectives:**
- Combine all learned Docker concepts into a final multi-container, orchestrated project.
- Implement Docker Compose or Docker Swarm with networking, volumes, environment variables, and user security.
- Document and present the end-to-end setup, including CI/CD and security considerations.

**Lab Steps (Example Project):**

1. **Requirements:**
   - 3 services: `frontend`, `backend`, `database`.
   - Docker Compose for local dev, Docker Swarm or similar for production.

2. **Compose/Swarm Deployment:**
   - Write a `docker-compose.yml` (or a Swarm stack file `stack.yml`) that defines each service.
   - Connect them on a shared network, storing data in volumes, and passing sensitive credentials securely.

3. **CI/CD Integration (Optional):**
   - Configure your CI pipeline to build and test each serviceâ€™s Docker image.
   - Push to a private registry, then automate deployment on success.

4. **Documentation & Presentation:**
   - Provide a short readme or presentation explaining how containers communicate, how data is persisted, how scaling is achieved, and how logs are collected.

5. **Reflection:**  
   - Record your performance benchmarks (time to build, memory usage, etc.).  
   - Note lessons learned: image optimization, network design, debugging strategies, and real-world production readiness.
